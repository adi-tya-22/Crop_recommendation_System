# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System

A **Flask-based web application** that recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and climatic conditions.  
The model is trained using **machine learning algorithms** on an agricultural dataset containing soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts the best crop to grow based on given soil & weather parameters  
- Interactive web interface built with **Flask**  
- User-friendly input form for data entry  
- Displays crop image and name as output  
- Deployable on **Render / Heroku / PythonAnywhere**

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- **N** – Nitrogen content in soil  
- **P** – Phosphorus content in soil  
- **K** – Potassium content in soil  
- **Temperature** (°C)  
- **Humidity** (%)  
- **pH**  
- **Rainfall** (mm)  

The target variable is the **recommended crop**.
